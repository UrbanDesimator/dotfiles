These are my config files if you find them useful you could star them thanks. all files used at your own risk.

My mpv dir has my custom mpv.conf for 1080p playback using cpu for decoding and gpu for shaders. All the scripts, shaders, fonts and uosc from https://github.com/tomasklaen/uosc "bit shout to tomasklaen ur usoc rocks" that I'm currently using.
I have spent a lot of time looking at mpv.conf other kind folks who have shared their's files and info. 
I have used the mpv manual extensivly and google to genrate my mpv.conf and maily use it to watch films and tv series @1080p, x264, x265 and hvec. 
I watch via a AMD FX 4 Core @4500Ghz 16GB ddr3 2133 Linux PC with an MSi Geforece GTX660 Ti twin frozr 3GB DDr5 and a 37" Toshiba TV at 1920x1080p connected via hdmi. One of biggest improvements I got was swapping TV mode from PC to Movie and googling sttings for my tv in that mode. 
I also use https://gitlab.com/lvml/mpv-plugin-xrandr which matches the display refresh rate with the fps of the file being played in mpv.
